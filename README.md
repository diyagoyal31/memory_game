Memory Puzzle Game Implementation

Welcome to the Memory Puzzle Game implementation using Python's Tkinter library. This simple yet engaging game challenges your memory as you flip tiles to find matching pairs. Below, you'll find an overview of the game structure and how to run it.

How to Play
Launch the game by running the provided Python script (MemoryPuzzleGame.py).
A grid of buttons will appear, each representing a tile in the memory puzzle.
Click on a tile to reveal its number.
Click on another tile to reveal its number.
If the numbers match, you've found a pair! The tiles will remain revealed.
If the numbers don't match, the tiles will be hidden again.
Repeat the process, trying to match all pairs in the least number of moves.
Implementation Details
The game is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. Here's a brief overview of the key components:

Grid Configuration: The game grid is dynamically generated with a specified number of rows and columns.

Tile Numbers: Pairs of numbers are generated, shuffled, and assigned to tiles on the grid.

Button Interface: Tkinter buttons are used to create the game interface, and each button is associated with a specific tile.

Flipping Tiles: Clicking on a button reveals the associated tile's number. The game allows revealing two tiles at a time.

Matching Pairs: The game checks if the numbers on the selected tiles match. If they do, the pair remains revealed; otherwise, the tiles are hidden again.

Winning Condition: The game concludes when all pairs have been successfully matched, displaying a congratulatory message.

Running the Game
To run the Memory Puzzle Game:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Run the provided Python script (MemoryPuzzleGame.py).
The game window will appear, and you can start playing!
Feel free to customize the game by adjusting the number of rows and columns in the MemoryPuzzleGame instantiation.
